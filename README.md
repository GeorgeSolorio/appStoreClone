# appStoreClone 

## About
A case study based on [Brian Voong's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA) tutorials on iOS. The app attempts to mock Apple's App Store behavior. 
These behaviors consist of fetching iTunes data, displaying multiple tab controllers, displaying data in scroll views and animated feedback

The project follows the MVC artchitecture along with an API service class. 
The entire app consits of four different tab controllers that demonstrate the data in four different ways

* Music tab consist of a Table View list with songs from Taylor Swift

* Today tab consists of todays' highly rated apps.

* Apps tab containing scrolls views that demonstrate a list of *editor's choice*, *top free iphone apps* and *top grossing apps*.

* A search tab that allows the user to search any app they look for

Each tab has it's own Model, View and Controller. The view's were also manually coded in order to gain better access of its size and display.

## Learning Objectives
* How to set up User interface
* Setup Decodable objects based on Itunes API
* Fetch Itunes data and convert JSON data into Swift decodable obejects
* Synchronize multiple fetches
* Snap collection view layouts scrolling
* Handle user interaction with animated feedback
* Manually setup auto layout contraints
* Setup navigation views and tab controllers

## Usage
You can run this project in Xcode and simulate the app on any desired Iphone simulator.
It should display a set of tabs consting of views that provide information about Itune's latest apps list

## Models ðŸ“¬
All model objects are located in the [models](https://github.com/GeorgeSolorio/appStoreClone/tree/master/appStoreClone/Model) folder

| File                   | Description                                    | Obejcts                                  |
| -----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| AppGroup.swift         | The root of three major feed objects           | AppGroup, Feed, FeedResult               |
| CustomerReviews.swift  | A set objects used for reviews                 | Reviews, ReviewFeed, Entry, Author, Label|
| SearchResult.swift     | A set of search result keys                    | SearchResult, Result                     |
| SocialApp.swift        | Holds keys for the app image information       | SocialApp                                |
| todayItem.swift        | Holds infomations about the apps detailed data | TodayItem                                |

Each model is used for mapping JSON data into Swift decodable structs from the Itunes API

## Views ðŸ–¼
You can find the View classes in the [Views](https://github.com/GeorgeSolorio/appStoreClone/tree/master/appStoreClone/Views) folder

| Folder                   | Description                                                                | Objects                               |
| -----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Apps                   | This folder consits of files that help display details about the fetched app | AppRowCell, AppHeaderCell, AppDetailCell, PreviewCell,  ReviewInfoCell, ReviewRowCell |
| Music                  | This folder helps display infomation about a given track                     | TrackCell, MusicLoadingFooter          |
| Today                  | This folder consits of files that help display information on the Today Tab  | TodayAppFullScreenHeaderCell, BaseTodayCell, MultipleAppCell, TodayAppFullScreenDescriptionCell, TodayAppFullScreenHeaderCell, TodayCell, TodayMutipleAppsCell |

## Controller ðŸ•¹
You can find the controller classes in the [Controller](https://github.com/GeorgeSolorio/appStoreClone/tree/master/appStoreClone/Controller) folder
| Controllers              | Description                                    |
| -------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| App                      | This folder helps initialize and display the app's tab view. Using tools from SwiftUI for its collection view and displaying details about apps in the scroll view|
| Today                    | This folder consits of code that helps display four main cells. Each cell displays information, provides user interaction and creates feedback by zooming in and out of a cell in an animated way |
| Base                   | A set of base controllers consisting of common behaviours found in many of our views. These objects allow us to speed up the process initializing controllers such as the TabBarController, BaseListController and HorizontalSnappingController |
| Search                 | This folder consists of a single file that makes use of Apple's UISearchController, allowing us to fetch user input |


## Service ðŸ“¥
You can find the Service class in the [Service](https://github.com/GeorgeSolorio/appStoreClone/tree/master/appStoreClone/Service) folder

## Third party services: SDWebImage 
We used SDWebImage to help us download and display images in a simpler and intuitive way
